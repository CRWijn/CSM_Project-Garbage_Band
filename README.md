# CSM_Project-Garbage_Band
Software Engineering Methods project from the Computer Science Minor
This project took place over the course of 10 weeks where we were learning about software
engineering methods (mainly focussed on the AGILE method). These methods were applied in
python project where the task was to develop a piece of software to help people work from
home. We decided to appeal to people who wanted to wanted to exert their musical side. This
project was created as a gateway into python programming. This was our groups first ever
python project.

In the file gb_pygame_1_4 run the run_garbage_band_1_4.py file to run the software.
